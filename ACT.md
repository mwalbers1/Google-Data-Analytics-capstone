## Act Phase

### Conclusions

A group of twenty four members were identified as having low activity between zero and one hour on at least one day as well has high sedentary activity for one or more days.  Among this group of twenty-four individuals, most individuals reported low activity on Thursdays.

Tuesdays and Wednesdays had the most number of users with high sedentary hours of at least 16 hours in a given day.

It is recommended that the fitness company reach out to these 24 people to address any concerns or questions and to offer suggestions on how to minimize future sedentary hours and to increase activity hours. This may help prevent losing some of these members.

Further analysis can be done for the number of steps tracked each day on average along with the average daily distances for the members.

Weekly reminders can be sent to the fitness community on Thursdays to remind members of the importance of exercise and to offer tips on how to balance their work lives with their exercise routines.
