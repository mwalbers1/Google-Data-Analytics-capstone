This data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

### CSV Data Files

The CSV files were downloaded to a project folder. Some files were not needed since they had information already present in other files.

The final list of files for this project are:

The validation results are in an Excel spreadsheet called dailyActivity_Validation.xlsx.
